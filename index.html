            <h3>CBOO Payroll System</h3>
            <p>
              Our capstone project was a payroll management system for a university's employee department. We aimed to improve efficiency and accuracy through features such as a client portal for viewing payroll and an admin portal for managing accounts and generating reports. This project was built using PHP as the backend language and MySQL as the database.
